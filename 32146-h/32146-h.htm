<span class="i0">The sun pour'd down upon the ripen'd grain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With quivering heat, and the suspended leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hung motionless. The cattle on the hills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood still, and the divided flock were all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laying their nostrils to the cooling roots,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sky look'd like silver, and it seem'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if the air had fainted, and the pulse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of nature had run down, and ceas'd to beat.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She drew refreshing water, and with thoughts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of God's sweet goodness stirring at her heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She bless'd her beautiful boy, and to his way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Committed him. And he went lightly on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his soft hands press'd closely to the cool<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stone vessel, and his little naked feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifted with watchful care, and o'er the hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thro' the light green hollows, where the lambs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go for the tender grass, he kept his way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wiling its distance with his simple thoughts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, in the wilderness of sheaves, with brows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Throbbing with heat, he set his burden down.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Stay'd not within the shadow of the tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But with a joyous industry went forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the reapers' places, and bound up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His tiny sheaves, and plaited cunningly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pliant withs out of the shining straw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cheering their labor on, till they forgot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The very weariness of their stooping toil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the beguiling of his earnest mirth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Presently he was silent, and his eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Closed as with dizzy pain, and with his hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Press'd hard upon his forehead, and his breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaving with the suppression of a cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He uttered a faint murmur, and fell back<br /></span>

<span class="i0">They bore him to his mother, and he lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon her knees till noon&mdash;and then he died!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She had watch'd every breath, and kept her hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft on his forehead, and gaz'd in upon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dreamy languor of his listless eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she had laid back all his sunny curls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kiss'd his delicate lip, and lifted him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into her bosom, till her heart grew strong&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His beauty was so unlike death! She leaned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over him now, that she might catch the low<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet music of his breath, that she had learn'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To love when he was slumbering at her side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his unconscious infancy&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i10">&mdash;"So still!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis a soft sleep! How beautiful he lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his fair forehead, and the rosy veins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Playing so freshly in his sunny cheek!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How could they say that he would die! Oh God!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could not lose him! I have treasured all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His childhood in my heart, and even now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he has slept, my memory has been there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Counting like ingots all his winning ways&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His unforgotten sweetness&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i10">&mdash;"Yet so still!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How like this breathless slumber is to death!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could believe that in that bosom now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There were no pulse&mdash;it beats so languidly!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cannot see it stir; but his red lip!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death would not be so very beautiful!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that half smile&mdash;would death have left <i>that</i> there?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;And should I not have felt that he would die?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And have I not wept over him?&mdash;and prayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Morning and night for him?&mdash;and <i>could</i> he die?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;No&mdash;God will keep him. He will be my pride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many long years to come, and this fair hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will darken like his father's, and his eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be of a deeper blue when he is grown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he will be so tall, and I shall look<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With such a pride upon him!&mdash;<i>He</i> to die!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fond mother lifted his soft curls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smiled, as if 'twere mockery to think<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That such fair things could perish&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i10">&mdash;Suddenly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her hand shrunk from him, and the color fled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From her fix'd lip, and her supporting knees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were shook beneath her child. Her hand had touch'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His forehead, as she dallied with his hair&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it was cold&mdash;like clay!&mdash;slow&mdash;very slow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came the misgiving that her child was dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She sat a moment and her eyes were clos'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a still prayer for strength, and then she took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His little hand and press'd it earnestly&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And put her lip to his&mdash;and look'd again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fearfully on him&mdash;and then, bending low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She whisper'd in his ear, "My son!&mdash;My son!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as the echo died, and not a sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broke on the stillness, and he lay there still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Motionless on her knee&mdash;the truth <i>would</i> come!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with a sharp, quick cry, as if her heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were crush'd, she lifted him and held him close<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into her bosom&mdash;with a mother's thought&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The moon was shining yet. The Orient's brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Set with the morning star, was not yet dim;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the deep silence which subdues the breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a strong feeling, hung upon the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As sleep upon the pulses of a child.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas the last watch of night. Gethsemane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With its bath'd leaves of silver, seem'd dissolv'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In visible stillness, and as Jesus' voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With its bewildering sweetness met the ear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his disciples, it vibrated on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the first whisper in a silent world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They came on slowly. Heaviness oppress'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Saviour's heart, and when the kindnesses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his deep love were pour'd, he felt the need<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of near communion, for his gift of strength<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was wasted by the spirit's weariness.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He left them there, and went a little on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the depth of that hush'd silentness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone with God, he fell upon his face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as his heart was broken with the rush<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his surpassing agony, and death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrung to him from a dying universe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were mightier than the Son of man could bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gave his sorrows way, and in the deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prostration of his soul, breathed out the prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Father, if it be possible with thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let this cup pass from me." Oh, how a word,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Like the forc'd drop before the fountain breaks,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Saviour felt its quiet in his soul;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though his strength was weakness, and the light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which led him on till now was sorely dim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He breathed a new submission&mdash;"Not my will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thine be done, oh Father!" As he spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Voices were heard in heaven, and music stole<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out from the chambers of the vaulted sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if the stars were swept like instruments.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No cloud was visible, but radiant wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were coming with a silvery rush to earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as the Saviour rose, a glorious one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With an illumin'd forehead, and the light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose fountain is the mystery of God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Encalm'd within his eye, bow'd down to him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nerv'd him with a ministry of strength.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was enough&mdash;and with his godlike brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Re-written, of his Father's messenger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With meekness, whose divinity is more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than power and glory, he return'd again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his disciples, and awak'd their sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For "he that should betray him was at hand."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He sat by me in school. His face is now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vividly in my mind, as if he went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From me but yesterday&mdash;its pleasant smile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the rich, joyous laughter of his eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the free play of his unhaughty lip,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So redolent of his heart! He was not fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor singular, nor over-fond of books,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never melancholy when alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was the heartiest in the ring, the last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Home from the summer's wanderings, and the first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the threshold when the school was done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All of us loved him. We shall speak his name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the far years to come, and think of him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When we have lost life's simplest passages,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His childhood had been wasted in the close<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And airless city. He had never thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the blue sky was ample, or the stars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many in heaven, or the chainless wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a medicinal freshness. He had learn'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perilous tricks of manhood, and his hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was ready, and his confidence in himself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bold as a quarreller's. Then he came away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the unshelter'd hills, and brought an eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New as a babe's to nature, and an ear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As ignorant of its music. He was sad.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The broad hill sides seem'd desolate, and the woods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gloomy and dim, and the perpetual sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wind and waters and unquiet leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the monotony of a dirge. He pined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the familiar things until his heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sicken'd for home!&mdash;and so he stole away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the most silent places, and lay down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To weep upon the mosses of the slopes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And follow'd listlessly the silver streams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till he found out the unsunn'd shadowings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the green openings to the sky, and grew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fond of them all insensibly. He found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet company in the brooks, and loved to sit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bathe his fingers wantonly, and feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wind upon his forehead; and the leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Took a beguiling whisper to his ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bird-voices music, and the blast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swept like an instrument the sounding trees.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His heart went back to its simplicity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the stirr'd waters in the night grow pure&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sadness and silence and the dim-lit woods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Won on his love so well&mdash;and he forgot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His pride and his assumingness, and lost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mimicry of the man, and so unlearn'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His very character till he became<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As diffident as a girl.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">'Tis very strange<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How nature sometimes wins upon a child.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Th' experience of the world is not on him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And poetry has not upon his brain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left a mock thirst for solitude, nor love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Writ on his forehead the effeminate shame<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Which hideth from men's eyes. He has a full,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shadowless heart, and it is always toned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More merrily than the chastened voice of winds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And waters&mdash;yet he often, in his mirth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stops by the running brooks, and suddenly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loiters, he knows not why, and at the sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the spread meadows and the lifted hills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feels an unquiet pleasure, and forgets<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To listen for his fellows. He will grow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fond of the early star, and lie awake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gazing with many thoughts upon the moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lose himself in the deep chamber'd sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his untaught philosophies. It breeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sadness in older hearts, but not in his;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he goes merrier to his play, and shouts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Louder the joyous call&mdash;but it will sink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into his memory like his mother's prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For after years to brood on.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Cheerful thoughts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came to the homesick boy as he became<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wakeful to beauty in the summer's change,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he came oftener to our noisy play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cheering us on with his delightful shout<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the hills, and giving interest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his keen spirit to the boyish game.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We loved him for his carelessness of himself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his perpetual mirth, and tho' he stole<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes away into the woods alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wandered unaccompanied when the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was beautiful, he was our idol still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we have not forgotten him, tho' time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has blotted many a pleasant memory<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of boyhood out, and we are wearing old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the unplayfulness of this grown up world.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And caught the light capriciously, like wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haunting the greenwood with a silvery sheen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stars might not be numbered, and the moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exceeding beautiful, went up in heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And took her place in silence, and a hush,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the deep Sabbath of the night, came down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rested upon nature. I was out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With three sweet sisters wandering, and my thoughts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Took color of the moonlight, and of them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I was calm and happy. Their deep tones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Low in the stillness, and by that soft air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Melted to reediness, bore out, like song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The language of high feelings, and I felt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How excellent is woman when she gives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the fine pulses of her spirit way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One was a noble being, with a brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ample and pure, and on it her black hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was parted, like a raven's wing on snow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her tone was low and sweet, and in her smile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You read intense affections. Her moist eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had a most rare benignity; her mouth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bland and unshadowed sweetness; and her face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was full of that mild dignity that gives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A holiness to woman. She was one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose virtues blossom daily, and pour out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fragrance upon all who in her path<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have a blest fellowship. I longed to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her brother, that her hand might lie upon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My forehead, and her gentle voice allay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fever that is at my heart sometimes.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There was a second sister who might witch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An angel from his hymn. I cannot tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The secret of her beauty. It is more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than her slight penciled lip, and her arch eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laughing beneath its lashes, as if life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were nothing but a merry mask; 'tis more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than motion, though she moveth like a fay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or music, though her voice is like a reed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blown by a low south wind; or cunning grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though all she does is beautiful; or thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or fancy, or a delicate sense, though mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is her best gift, and poetry her world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she will see strange beauty in a flower<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As by a subtle vision. I care not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To know how she bewitches; 'tis enough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For me that I can listen to her voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dream rare dreams of music, or converse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon unwrit philosophy, till I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Am wildered beneath thoughts I cannot bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the red lip that breathes them.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">On my arm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaned an unshadowed girl, who scarcely yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had numbered fourteen summers. I know not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How I shall draw her picture&mdash;the young heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has such a restlessness of change, and each<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of its wild moods so lovely! I can see<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Her figure in its rounded beauty now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her half-flying step, her clustering hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bathing a neck like Hebe's, and her face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By a glad heart made radiant. She was full<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the romance of girlhood. The fair world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was like an unmarred Eden to her eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every sound was music, and the tint<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of every cloud a silent poetry.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Light to thy path, bright creature! I would charm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy being if I could, that it should be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever as now thou dreamest, and flow on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus innocent and beautiful to heaven!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We walked beneath the full and mellow moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the late stars had risen. It was not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In silence, though we did not seem to break<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hush with our low voices; but our thoughts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stirred deeply at their sources; and when night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Divided us, I slumbered with a peace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Floating about my heart, which only comes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From high communion. I shall never see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That silver moon again without a crowd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of gentle memories, and a silent prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That when the night of life shall oversteal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your sky, ye lovely sisters! there may be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A light as beautiful to lead you on.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Winter is come again. The sweet south west<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is a forgotten wind, and the strong earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has laid aside its mantle to be bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the frost fetter. There is not a sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save of the skaiter's heel, and there is laid<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Spring has a rushing sound, and Summer sends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many sweet voices with its odors out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Autumn rustleth its decaying robe<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There are no sunny places to lie down.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From his white shoulders by the winds were swept,<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I had a passion when I was a child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a most pleasant idleness. In June,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the thick masses of the leaves were stirr'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a just audible murmur, and the streams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fainted in their cool places to a low<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unnotic'd tinkle, and the reapers hung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their sickles in the trees and went to sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then might you find me in an antique chair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cushion'd with cunning luxury, which stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the old study corner, by a nook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crowded with volumes of the old romance;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there, the long and quiet summer day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay I with half clos'd eyelids, turning o'er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaf after leaf, until the twilight blurr'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their singular and time-stain'd characters.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas a forgetful lore, and it is blent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With dreams that in my fitful slumber came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And is remember'd faintly. But to-day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the strange waywardness of human thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A story has come back to me which I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had long forgotten, and I tell it now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because it hath a savour that I find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But seldom in the temper of the world.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Angelo turn'd away. He was a poor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unhonor'd minstrel, and he might not breathe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love to the daughter of an Earl. She rais'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proudly her beautiful head, and shook away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From her clear temples the luxuriant hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And told him it would ever please her well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To listen to his minstrelsy, but love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was for a loftier lip&mdash;and then the tear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stole to her flashing eye, for as she spoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There rose up a remembrance of his keen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unstooping spirit, and his noble heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Given her like a sacrifice, and she held<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Low on his bosom, and remain'd awhile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lost in his bitter thoughts&mdash;and then again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lifted to its height his slender form,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">You may hear birds at morning, and at eve<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Smell of my violets! I found them where<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The liquid South stole o'er them, on a bank<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lean'd to running water. There's to me<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Is in the blue cups trembling, and they nod<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So gracefully to the kisses of the wind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It may be deem'd unmanly, but the wise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Read nature like the manuscript of heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And call the flowers its poetry. Go out!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye spirits of habitual unrest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And read it when the "fever of the world"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath made your hearts impatient, and, if life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath yet one spring unpoison'd, it will be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a beguiling music to its flow,<br /></span>
